# Chloe's Digital Garden 🌸
👋 Hey, I'm Chloe! As a chronic learner, I like my life with organized chaos.. hence the ~~scattered folder under folder garden~~. 📁

💡 One of my personal goals this year is to become more intentional with my identity of loving learning. Here's me committing it into existence. 🪴

> 🌴  Building since July 26, 2021 and deployed on July 27, 2021. Still building and transferring files. There are also a loooot of broken links! I prematurely deployed since I was really excited about building it online. 💪
