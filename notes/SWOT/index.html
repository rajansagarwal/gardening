I'm in love with learning! And I genuinely want to become more intentional with it.. here's me committing it into existence. 🌸\n\n🧠 In this garden/ [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), I publish my learning notes, journeys, and projects as [evergreen notes](https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-evergreen-notes/) that I continue to cultivate and grow–there is no perfect *end state*, and it will always be a work in progress! My notes range from fleeting notes to completely fleshed out permanent notes. I write more about digital gardens [here.](home/garden.md)\n\n👋 When I'm not here, you can find me curating in [Are.na](https://are.na/chloe-abrasada) or reading in [Matter](https://getmatter.app/chloeabrasada). Right now, I'm also building a passion project on sustainability called [Sirkular, where I'm jumpstarting with critiquing sustainable fashion](https://www.are.na/developh-camp/ph-sustainable-fashion).\n\n\u003e ***“When learning is purposeful, creativity blossoms.

I actually have a second name that I don't use for branding purposes *(jkjk)*. I'm a productivity nerd 👩‍🏫, web lurker 💻, and design enthusiast 🎨.\n\n📚 I'm currently studying Occupational therapy in UP Manila. Alongside that, I'm a UX designer currently working with different start-ups (diverse fields, yes!). I also advocate for mental health and sustainability and am passionate about volunteering.\n\n## 🧠\nMy thinking is shaped by the lovely programs I've personally grown my knowledge with.\n- Reshaped my relationship with knowledge as a [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) scholar\n- Questioned my assumptions on technology, creativity, and design as a [Developh](https://developh.org/) Camp fellow\n- Defining (currently!) my principles as a [OpenPrinciples](https://openprinciples.org/) fellow\n\n## 🔗 Links\n- I publish my works here at my [portfolio](https://chloeabrasada.online/) and [Behance.](https://www.behance.net/chloeabrasada)\n- Let's connect at [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloeabrasada) or shout at me on [Twitter](https://twitter/com/chloeabrasada).\n- I like writing at [Medium](https://chloeabrasada.medium.com/) and my (wow i need to revive this) [personal blog](https://blog.chloeabrasada.onlne/).\n- I like dumping my brain in [Are.na,](https://www.are.na/chloe-abrasada) and reading long chunks of text in [Matter.](https://getmatter.app/chloeabrasada).\n\n## 🍉 Luvs...\n\n🥳 I'm in love with learning, building, and creating! So I pretty much *can* get interested at anything, but here are some of the things that really pique my interest:\n\n- I like learning about health in general! I've been a health nut (I don't drink carbonated drinks lol) for a huge part of my life and have been working out consistently since the start of 2021 after *yeeeeaaaarsss* of having month-long exercise stints.\n- Mental health! I started my advocacy journey back in 2018, and it has been a huge part of who I am.\n- Productivity! I'm a tool \u0026 tip hoarder. Most of my notes are still scattered everywhere since I jump through tools and scavenge a lot of things.\n- ✨ Design ✨\n- Philosophy! I try to practice [stoicism](moc/stoicism.md) and am trying to transition into practicing it more. Since I started in 2021, I also journal daily, reflect monthly, and have an annual year-round up!\n- Psychology! One of my goals is to read this huge repository of psychology books.. but I haven't found the luxury to do so yet. 💭 I like [personality tests](notes/personality-tests.md) and [self-awareness.](notes/self-awareness.md)\n- Anything related to personal development! I'm trying to get into reading more non-fiction books this year. I recently read [Atomic Habits by James Clear](notes/sources/books/atomic-habits.md). I'm also subscribed to a loooot of [newsletters](notes/sources/newsletters.md) and make time to read them.\n- Leadership and facilitation 👥\n- Music 🎧 I have over a hundred playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/chloeabrasada) and am constantly on the lookout for good finds. I'm also a bathroom singer and frustrated guitarist/ pianist. I sometimes post in [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/chloeabrasada) lol.\n- Sitcoms! When I'm too tired to do anythiiing, I like spending my time watching lighthearted shows for the sake of just smiling.\n- Dogs... 🐶\n- Tea lol. I like green tea \u0026 chai. 🍵 Also, tea \u003e coffee.",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.974458614Z",title:"About Me"},"/home/building-this-website":{content:"### Oldest to latest\n- `07/26/2021` **Quartz** Set-up\n-  `07/27/2021` Site actually FINALLY up lol struggled through that\n	-  **What I didn't know before this lol**\n		-  Wikilinks don't work on Github Pages\n		-  Doesn't support spaces\n-  `07/29/2021` Fixed backlinks\n	-  **What I didn't know before this**\n		-  There was an error in my `config.toml`\n-  `07/29/2021` Change color of page\n- `07/31/2021` Add \"Let's go back\" on 404\n	- [How to make an HTML back link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8814472/how-to-make-an-html-back-link)\n- `08/01/2021` Add date late updated at footer\n	- [Last modified date of a file on a website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1034794/last-modified-date-of-a-file-on-a-web-site)\n- `08/01/2021` Add changelog at footer\n	- Obsidian Vault changelog plug-in\n	- **What I didn't know before this**\n		- Won't really work without frontmatter\n- `08/02/2021` Add option to remove TOC\n- `08/03/2021` Add arrow to external links\n	- [Superscript in CSS only? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/501671/superscript-in-css-only/501696)\n-  `08/07/2021` Change fonts \u0026 add text-background on hover\n-   `08/07/2021` Make external links open new tab\n	* [How to Make Links Open in a New Window or Tab (thesitewizard.com)](https://www.thesitewizard.com/html-tutorial/open-links-in-new-window-or-tab.shtml#:~:text=How%20to%20Open%20Hyperlinks%20in,your%20links%20(anchor%20tags).\u0026text=Now%20when%20your%20visitors%20click,how%20they%20configured%20that%20browser)\n- Forgot to input a lot of stuff lmao\n- `01292021` Received the quartz 3.0 update and giving back life to the garden~\n\n***Lol look at that struggle...*** 🐒\n![github-struggle](/photos/github-struggle.png)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.974458614Z",title:"Building this Website"},"/home/corner":{content:"\u003e Note: #in-progress/garden \n\n- [Tooling](moc/tooling)\n- [To Read](moc/to-read.md)\n- **Things at the top of my ahead I want to learn about** #come-back \n	- [Organization structures](notes/career/hr/org-structures.md)\n	- [Authenticity](notes/perdev/life-advice/authenticity.md)\n	- [Project roadmapping](notes/project-roadmapping.md)\n\n`08112021` **2~ weeks with Obsidian!** The pink ones are my private notes while the blue ones are the ones in this garden! ✌️\n![obsidian-graph](/photos/obsidian-graph.png)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.974458614Z",title:"Chloe's Corner"},"/home/garden":{content:"---\n\nThis digital garden is one of my personal projects this year!

In this page, I map out how this garden is structured for ease of navigation. There are a lot of links \u0026 backlinks, so it can get confusing! 😵‍💫\n\n## Structure 🏛\nDigital gardens are composed of notes that are interlinked for the purpose of linking thinking. As such, there are notes inside notes.\n\nI structured my garden in this manner from when you navigate from the homepage. While it does seem linear, all notes are actually interconnected! So you can jump from one note to another and find one note also in another note.\n\nI talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Here's a basic outline of what navigating looks like:\n\n![garden-new-structure](/photos/garden-new-structure.png)\n\n### Basically... 🎧\n- Home 🏡\n	- Entry point towards all the notes. The main points of navigation and entry points are stored there.\n- **From the Home** 🗺\n	- **Main Maps of Content** 🌞\n		- I store these at the home page. I sorted these according to overarching ideas or themes between some notes. They contain general topics that branch to specific topics as you enter.\n	- **Projects** 🥰\n		- The projects sections contain the projects I publish (more of the thinking processes instead of the final product!).\n- **Types of Notes** 🤩\n	- From the entry points, I have different types of notes. I talk more about the notes system more in [gardening-system.](notes/home/gardening-system.md) Essentially, here are the types of notes:\n		- #permanent-notes 🫀\n			- In these notes, I write in the highlights I read and the thought processes I generated along with them.\n		- #personal-learnings  ✍️\n			- These notes contain solely my writings from personal learnings.\n		- #repository  💳\n			- These notes contain links and sources for the theme associated with them.\n- **Others** 🥳\n	- **Related Notes** 🚗\n		- The related notes section contains all the notes in which the current note you are in is mentioned. They're all clickable!\n	- **Interactive Graph** 📊\n		- The interactive graph displays the connections between the different notes.

Your brand defines why you are in existence, your raison d’être. “Experience” on the other hand describes how you live and grow. Therefore, brand experience quite literally describes ==how the brand is experienced by potential and existing customers before, during and after any and all interactions, throughout its existence.==\n		- The most well known brands that exist today place strong emphasis on brand experience. ==Apple is an obvious example. From the retail store, to the packaging, to the interface, all the points in which we interact with Apple are curated and harmonious with the overall brand experience.==\n	- Elements that create a successful brand experience\n		- Brand design\n		- Brand voice\n		- User experience\n		- Brand image, and\n		- Customer support\n	- How-to\n		- Discover your purpose\n			- Defining who you are will set the tone of the type of experience you want to create. In an oversaturated market, products that are connected to a bigger purpose can stand out from the crowd—the purpose often has more value than the product itself. What is your brand’s higher purpose?\n		- Focus on storytelling\n			- What’s your brand’s story?  How did you come to be? How are you improving lives?\n		- Be consistent\n		- Find opportunities for engagement\n		- Put experiences over sales\n- Brand Experience:What Is It? How Is It Measured? Does It Affect Loyalty?[^2]\n	- Brand experience is conceptualized as ==sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli== that are part of a brand’s design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments.\n	- However, they are also exposed to various specific brand-related stimuli, such as ==brand-identifying colors== (Bellizzi and Hite 1992; Gorn et al. 1997; Meyers-Levy and Peracchio 1995), ==shapes== (Veryzer and Hutchinson 1998), typefaces, background design elements (Mandel and Johnson 2002), ==slogans, mascots, and brand characters== (Keller 1987). These brand-related stimuli appear as part of a brand’s design and identity (e.g., name, logo, signage), packaging, and marketing communications (e.g., advertisements, brochures, Web sites) and in environments in which the brand is marketed or sold (e.g., stores, events). These brand-related stimuli constitute the major source of subjective, internal consumer responses, which we refer to as “brand experience.”\n	- Thus, we conceptualize brand experience as ==subjective, internal consumer responses (sensations, feelings, and cognitions) and behavioral responses== evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand’s design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments.\n	- In line with our conceptualization, the experience dimensions are evoked by brand-related stimuli (e.g., ==colors, shapes, typefaces, designs, slogans, mascots, brand characters==). Note that there is no one-to-one correspondence, such that a certain stimulus type would trigger a certain experience dimension and only that dimension. \n	- As Table 1 shows, participants provided descriptions of sensations (e.g., “touch and feel,” “appeal to different senses,” “smells nice and is visually warm”), a wide range of feelings (e.g., “fun,” “refreshed,” “inspired,” “nostalgia”), analytical and imaginative thoughts (e.g., “the brand intrigues me,” “I think of topics like animal testing, purity and wellness,” “reminds me to use my imagination”), and behaviors (e.g., “I change the way I organize and interact with information,” “I want to work out,” “It’s a place I want to go”).\n	- Accordingly, we conceptualized brand experience as ==subjective consumer responses that are evoked by specific brand-related experiential attributes in such settings.== We demonstrated that brand experience can be broken down into four dimensions (==sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioral==), which are differentially evoked by various brands.\n\n![brand-xp-1](/photos/brand-xp-1.png)\n![brand-xp-2](/photos/brand-xp-2.png)\n\n- [Brand Experience: What is it and How Do You Maximize It? | Widen](https://www.widen.com/blog/brand-experience)\n	- Brand experience is the ==sum of all the sensations, thoughts, feelings, and reactions== that individuals have in response to a brand. Brand experience is not specific to a channel or media type. Rather, it’s the result — or the lasting impression — that ==remains after someone encounters or engages with a brand in any environment==.\n	- UX vs brand xp\n		- Unlike brand experience, ==user experience speaks specifically to a person’s takeaway from their interaction with a brand’s products, services, people, software, or other offerings==.

Some examples are unending workstream, unjust compenstation, etc.\n- Burnout within organization is not something that can be solved through "days-off" and "giving people self-care apps". The best way to approach this problem is through looking at the causes of burnout.\n\n## Highlights\n- These “extra days off” and “mental health resources” do not solve the problem. If you’re slammed with work, you can’t take the days off because you need to get the work done. No amount of talking to a tele-therapist will finish those iMeet logs, Excel files and PowerPoint decks all on the same damn projects that you’re stressed out of your mind trying to get done by deadline.\n- burnout is caused by working with seemingly no end. It is a form of exhaustion. It is not, at its core, a mental health issue - it is an issue with being overloaded and having no respite from said overload, and trying to solve it by offering “mental health” and “wellness” and “meditation” stuff is disingenuous.\n- The cause of burnout is usually too much work, and the solution to too much work is to make sure they have more time to do their work or add more people so that they have less work to do. It’s a symptom of someone being overwhelmed by the tasks they’re receiving or the way they’re receiving the tasks, and is - that’s right folks! - regularly caused by bad management and organizational mechanisms.\n- If a company actually wants to deal with burnout, you should find out what causes burnout and then deal with that. Oftentimes it isn’t just the volume of work, but the conditions in which said work is done, which is often caused by middle managers that exist only to delegate and never to assist or empower.\n- The solution isn’t to look at workers and say “okay, you’ve got burnout, time to relax,” but to look at the root causes and work out how to avoid that in the future, be it through not piling on so much work at once or giving them direct assistance to do the work.\n- Burnout is not a mental health issue, it is an organizational issue that causes mental and physical health issues.',lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Burnout is an organizational issue"},"/notes/buyer-personas":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n\n## Sources\n- [Buyer Persona Template \u0026 Persona Examples - Milanote](https://milanote.com/templates/marketing/buyer-persona)\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Buyer personas"},"/notes/candidate-red-flags":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [getting-hired](notes/getting-hired.md)\n	- [interviews](quartz/content/notes/interviews.md)\n\n\n## Notes [^1]\n1.

The stress is on recycling, made possible by designing products so that they can easily be taken apart.\n\nSeveral scientific studies (see references) describe the concept as an “idealised vision”, a “mix of various ideas from different domains”, or a “vague idea based on pseudo-scientific concepts”. There’s three main points of criticism, which we discuss below.\n\n1. **The first dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the fact that the recycling process of modern products is far from 100% efficient.**\n    1. The more complex a product, the more steps and processes it takes to recycle. In each step of this process, resources and energy are lost.\n    2. Furthermore, in the case of electronic products, the production process itself is much more resource-intensive than the extraction of the raw materials, meaning that recycling the end product can only recuperate a fraction of the input.\n    3. And while some plastics are indeed being recycled, this process only produces inferior materials (“downcycling”) that enter the waste stream soon afterwards.\n    4. The low efficiency of the recycling process is, on its own, enough to take the ground from under the concept of the circular economy: the loss of resources during the recycling process always needs to be compensated with more over-extraction of the planet’s resources. Recycling processes will improve, but recycling is always a trade-off between maximum material recovery and minimum energy use. And that brings us to the next point.\n2. **How can you recycle energy sources?**\n    1. The second dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the fact that 20% of total resources used worldwide are fossil fuels. More than 98% of that is burnt as a source of energy and can’t be re-used or recycled.\n    2. As energy is transferred or transformed, its quality diminishes (second law of thermodynamics). For example, it’s impossible to operate one car or one power plant with the excess heat from another. Consequently, there will always be a need to mine new fossil fuels. Besides, recycling materials also requires energy, both through the recycling process and the transportation of recycled and to-be-recycled materials.\n    3. To this, the supporters of the circular economy have a response: we will shift to 100% renewable energy. But this doesn’t make the circle round: to build and maintain renewable energy plants and accompanied infrastructures, we also need resources (both energy and materials). What’s more, technology to harvest and store renewable energy relies on difficult-to-recycle materials. That’s why solar panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries are not recycled, but landfilled or incinerated.\n3. **Input exceeds output**\n    1. The third dent in the credibility of the circular economy is the biggest: the global resource use – both energetic and material – keeps increasing year by year.\n4. **Accumulation of resources**\n    1. A considerable segment of all resources – about a third of the total – are neither recycled, nor incinerated or dumped: they are accumulated in buildings, infrastructure, and consumer goods. In 2005, 62 Gt of resources were used globally. After subtracting energy sources (fossil fuels and biomass) and waste from the mining sector, the remaining 30 Gt were used to make material goods. Of these, 4 Gt was used to make products that last for less than one year (disposable products).\n\nA more responsible use of resources is of course an excellent idea. But to achieve that, recycling and re-use alone aren’t enough. Since 71% of all resources cannot be recycled or re-used (44% of which are energy sources and 27% of which are added to existing stocks), you can only really get better numbers by reducing total use.\n\n\n\n[^1]: [How Circular is the Circular Economy? - Local Futures](https://www.localfutures.org/how-circular-is-the-circular-economy/)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Circular Economy"},"/notes/collective-effervesence":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [notes/emotions-contagious](notes/emotions-contagious.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights\n- We find our greatest bliss in moments of collective effervescence. It’s a concept coined in the early 20th century by the pioneering sociologist Émile Durkheim to describe the sense of energy and harmony people feel when they come together in a group around a shared purpose.

And during this pandemic, it’s been largely absent from our lives.[^1]\n	- Collective effervescence happens when joie de vivre spreads through a group.

However, this idea that the "climb should be hard" is not progress, we are instead putting on research debt.\n- Research debt can come in the form of poor exposition, undigested ideas, bad abstractations and notation, and noise.\n- When faced with these, people have to exert interpretative labor which varies depending on the material presented.\n- [We must move forward into research distillation](notes/research-distillation.md). While many people want to do this, there are barriers such as: perverse incentive, don\'t enjoy distillation, [there is lack of support in research](notes/lack-of-support-in-research.md).\n\n## Highlights\n[Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)[^1]\n- The climb isn’t progress: the climb is a mountain of debt.\n- Research can also have debt.\n	- Poor Exposition\n	- Undigested Ideas \n	- Bad abstractions and notation - Unfortunately, we often get stuck with the first formalisms to develop even when they’re bad. \n	- Noise \n- Interpretaive Labor\n- There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. \n- On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called interpretive labor.\n- In these one-to-many cases, each member of the audience pays the cost of understanding, even though the cost of explaining stays the same. 3 As a result, the cost of understanding has a multiplier in the interpretive labor tradeoff — sometimes a huge multiplier. 4\n- Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member.\n- Young ideas aren’t ending points for us to put in a paper and abandon. When we let things stop there the debt piles up. It becomes harder to understand and build on each other’s work and the field fragments.\n- It’s a lack of digesting ideas – or, at least, a lack of the public version of ideas being digested. \n- Research distillation\n- Research distillation is the opposite of research debt. It can be incredibly satisfying, combining deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design to do justice to our research and lay bare beautiful insights.\n- Distillation is also hard. It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea.\n- This leaves us with no easy way out. We can’t solve research debt by having one person write a textbook: their energy is spread too thin to polish every idea from scratch. We can’t outsource distillation to less skilled non-experts: refining and explaining ideas requires creativity and deep understanding, just as much as novel research.\n- Where are the distillers?\n	- Perverse incentives, like wanting your work to look difficult. Those certainly exist, but we don’t think they’re the main factor. 6 Another possibility is that they don’t enjoy research distillation. Again, we don’t think that’s what’s going on.\n	- We don’t support them. 7\n	- An aspiring research distiller lacks many things that are easy to take for granted: a career path, places to learn, examples and role models. Underlying this is a deeper issue: their work isn’t seen as a real research contribution. We need to fix this.\n\n\n\n[^1]: [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)',lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Make research accessible to the public"},"/notes/emotions-contagious":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [collective-effervesence](notes/collective-effervesence.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n- You feel the emotions around the people around you. Some examples of these are collective anxiety, Zoom fatigue, etc.\n\n## Highlights\n- When the pandemic began in 2020, the first negative emotion to spread was fear. Waves of panic crashed through communities, compelling people to purify packages and hoard hand sanitizer. As too many people lost loved ones, too many others lost jobs and everyone lost some semblance of normal life. The number of adults with symptoms of depression or anxiety spiked from one in 10 Americans to about four in 10.[^1]\n	- And there’s reason to believe these symptoms haven’t been caused only by the crisis itself — they’ve actually been transferred from person to person. Studies show that if your spouse, your family member or your roommate develops depression, you’re at heightened risk for it. And contagion isn’t limited to face-to-face interaction: Emotions can spread through social media posts and text messages, too.\n\n[^1]: [There’s a Specific Kind of Joy We’ve Been Missing](https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/opinion/sunday/covid-group-emotions-happiness.amp.html)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Emotions are contagious"},"/notes/empathy":{content:"- [We are unkind because we our empathy is limited](notes/perdev/kindness/unkind.md.)\n- [Empathy is in admitting that we don't understand](notes/perdev/kindness/dont-understand.md)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Empathy"},"/notes/ethics-activities":{content:"- [Ethics Litmus Tests](https://www.ethical-litmus.site/)\n	- [PDF Version](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e37fdff744ec95bb01b2d78/t/5ea16e5ef09f7c126e43b392/1587637871092/ethics-litmus-tests-web.pdf)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Ethics Activities"},"/notes/expressing-emotions":{content:"- [We often think someone doesn't express emotion because they don't want to, but what if they just don't feel any](notes/sciences/psycho/expressing-emotions/dont-want-to-express.md)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"On expressing emotions"},"/notes/facebook":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n- **References**\n	- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/marketing-on-facebook/how-to-create-a-facebook-page)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights\n- Start with a Facebook page\n	- 1.9 billion users and growing\n	- You can use ==facebook targeting tools== \u0026 ==facebook insights==\n	- Boost SEO without expense\n	- Get found\n- Setting a username\n	- Make it unique\n- Set brand experience\n### Practices\n1.

Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I've seen people give feedback differently, and I think there's no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective. I adjust my approach, but what I always seek to maintain is to relay feedback in a **constructive manner that helps a person move forward concretely**.\n\nA common argument against taking a very systematic and calculated approach is that we take away the directness of things.

STAR Method\n	- **SITUATION:** Give the interviewer context by describing the situation.\n	- **TASK:** What did you need to do? \n	- **ACTION:**  What were your specific actions?\n	- **RESULT:** What was the end result? What did you learn? How did it affect others?\n2. Elevator Pitch\n3. Problem-Solution-Benefit[^1]\n	- Answer should contain: A problem you faced, Your solution, The benefit to your employer.\n	- Sample\n		- *(Problem)* I had to work with another programmer who complained a lot about our projects.\n		- *(Solution)* I took the time to learn about his personal life. It turned out he was going through a tough divorce. Once I got to know him, he was actually a great coworker.\n		- *(Benefit to employer)* We worked so well together after that we were the most efficient programming pair in the company.\n4. CAR Method\n	- Challenge\n	- Actions\n	- Result\n\n## General Tips\n1. Stay honest.\n2. Use research to guide your answer.\n3. Convey healthy enthusiasm.\n4. Be prepared.	\n5. Draw from the job description.\n6. Prepare specific examples.\n7. Take your time answering.\n\n## How to Prepare for the Interview\n1. Research the company and your interviewers.\n2. Practice your answers to common interview questions.\n3. Study the job description and note required skills, qualities, and experience.\n4. Answer the questions using the STAR Method.\n5. Recruit a friend to practice answering questions.\n6. Be prepared with examples of your work.\n7. Plan your interview attire the night before.\n8. Prepare smart questions for your interviewers.\n9. Bring copies of your resume, a notebook, and pen.\n10. Tie your answers back to your skills and accomplishments.\n\n## Questions\nGeneral Sources[^2] [^3] [^1] [^4]\n### General, Informational\n1. Tell me about yourself.\n	- Approach A [^3]\n		- Start by describing your \u003cu\u003ebackground with a summary of your most impressive responsibilities\u003c/u\u003e\n			- *\"I've been a hostess at XYZ Restaurant for just over two years where I greet and seat customers, assess wait times, fulfill to-go orders and answer the phones. I love the lively and busy environment—we often have Friday and Saturday wait times of one hour or more...”*\n		- Next, briefly summarize your previous experience with \u003cu\u003ekey achievements\u003c/u\u003e\n			- **\"...Before working at XYZ Restaurant, I worked in retail as a floor associate for five years. Working in retail developed the customer service skills that make me a great hostess, offering a top-tier dining experience from the moment customers walk in the door. It also equipped me with the ability to work quickly under pressure...\"*\n		- Lastly, express how you found the new job and why it's a good fit for you and your goals\n			- *\"...I've enjoyed and grown in my current role, but wish to expand and utilize my customer service expertise in an elite restaurant environment. I am interested in your restaurant because of its reputation for delivering first in class service to your patrons in a lively, dynamic environment.”*\n	- Approach B\n		- FORD Method\n			- Family\n			- Occupation\n			- Recreation\n			- Dream\n2. Why do you want to work here? [^5] [^6]\n	- Don't answer something that's selfish. Think of it as \u003cu\u003e“Why would this company want to hire me?”\u003c/u\u003e\n	- Ask yourself:\n	- \u003cu\u003eHow can you help the company succeed?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- Read up on what’s happening with the company and its industry. Has it recently changed its product or service offerings? What competitive pressures is it facing? Consider this landscape and think, “What knowledge and experience do I have that would be especially useful to this employer right now?”\n    - \u003cu\u003eWhat past career successes could you potentially repeat at this company?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- In previous jobs, how did you meet or exceed your employers’ expectations? What problems did you play a major role in solving? What ideas did you introduce that helped the company save money or otherwise boost its bottom line? What lessons have you learned that you could apply in the future to create value for the potential employer?\n	- \u003cu\u003eHow will you complement the company’s culture?\u003c/u\u003e\n		- A candidate’s ability to fit within the organizational culture is an important hiring factor for many employers. So, do your homework on the company’s culture and **identify what you find most appealing about it.** For instance, if the firm encourages entrepreneurial thinking and that’s important to you, include that in your response.\n    - Examples\n        - *“I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking/fast-moving company/industry, and I feel I can do so by/with my … ”*\n        - *“I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to this position because … ”*\n        - *“I believe I have the type of knowledge to succeed in this role and at the company because … ”*\n        - *“I’m excited about this job opportunity, as it would allow me to … ”*\n3. What's your most impressive win in your career this far?\n	- Tells of what does this person think is successful. Is it really impressive?[^12]\n4. Why should we hire you?\n	- **EXPERIENCE** Show that you have \u003cu\u003eskills and experience\u003c/u\u003e to do the job and deliver great results.\n	- **WORK CULTURE** Highlight that \u003cu\u003eyou’ll fit in and be a great addition\u003c/u\u003e to the team.\n	- **IMPACT** Describe how hiring you will make their life easier and help them achieve more.\n	- **CAPABILITY** Show enthusiasm for performing required duties, not just capability.\n	- *Sample:* Oh wow, where do I begin! I have been an avid traveler since as young as I can remember. When I reached adulthood and started booking flights for myself, your airline would be my top choice. Alpha Airlines has always made long-distance travel a pleasure, and I would be honored to say that I work for you. On top of this, I believe that my patience and multitasking skills are second to none, and these would go a long way in helping me the best flight attendant possible.\n	- *What not to answer:* Money, perks, skills, desperation, general interest\n5. What can you bring to the company?\n6. Can you explain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job?\n	- *Sample:* I certainly can! Well, from what I’ve read on your company’s roadmap plans posted online, it sounds like you need a project manager who is capable of handling other departmental roles, as well. I couldn’t find a way to succinctly describe it on my resume, but during my internship at BioGenCo, I spent a month each on five different teams to get a handle on how the company functions as a whole. Now, with my supervisory experience where I’ve raised output by 32%, I believe I am well equipped to be the best project manager, while also being knowledgeable of the roles of other departments.\n7.

This is your chance to demonstrate your industry knowledge.\n	- Examples[^10]\n		- Can you show me examples of projects I'd be working on?\n		- What are the skills and experience you're looking for in an ideal candidate?\n		- What are the most immediate problems that would need to be addressed?\n		- What does a typical day look like?\n		- Do you expect the main responsibilities for this position to change in the next six years?\n		- Is this a new role that has been created?\n		- Are there opportunities for advancement or professional development?\n		- How will I be trained?\n		- What are the most important things you'd like to see someone accomplish in the first 30, 60, 90, days on the job?\n		- Where have previous successful employees in this position progressed to?\n\n## Others\n- **How to answer interview questions you don't know the answer to**[^11]\n	1. **Take your time**\n	2. **Think aloud**\n		- \"Add transitional adverbs like “first,” “then,” and “lastly” to give your answer some structure. You can also finish off with a qualifying statement that “the process varies depending on the situation,” which shows that you’re flexible even if your answer isn’t what the hiring manager would do.\"\n	3. **Redirect**\n		- \"If you simply don’t have it, try redirecting the answer to something you do have experience with.\"\n	4. **Have a fail-safe**\n		- \"Be prepared with a fail-safe answer that focuses on your enthusiasm for the position and knowledge of the industry. Something like, “That’s not a concept I’m really familiar with yet, but finance is something I’m really excited about, and I’ve been actively trying to learn more. I’ve been keeping up with deals and have read about a few that your company has been involved in. I’ve also learned a lot about the industries that you advise.

Websites\n2. Local business listings and review sites\n	- Google My Business\n	- Places for Business\n	- Usually free\n3. Social media\n	- Facebook, Twitter\n4. Mobile apps\n\n\u003e What you want customers to do and create a home for all of these.\n\nSocial media vs mobile app\n- A social media profile is a quick, simple and cheap way for Addie to establish an online presence. This should be the first step she takes to help customers engage with her and her business.\n- After Addie has established her social media profile, she can then look at longer-term investments such as building a mobile app, which could help customers find out more information and place orders.\n\n## How websites work\n- Server–Computer connected to the internet with a software that allows it to store or host pieces of your website\n	- \"Serves up right content when requested\"\n	- Each one has it's own address/ Internet protocol (IP) address\n		- String of numbers that stand for a certain part of the internet\n\n### [Domains](notes/domains.md)\n- How potential customers will find you\n- Type into browser window to go to any site\n- www.(domainname).com -\u003e Part that people use to find website\n	- Communicating with server -\u003e Send information needed -\u003e So person using can see what they're looking for\n	- Browser figures out which server it is located -\u003e Server \u0026 browser communicate -\u003e Server sends back information needed\n\n\u003e Server hosts site. Domain name helps people find it.\n\n\u003e To launch a website you need to get what’s called hosting space. Think of it like a plot of land for a house. Sometimes you have to pay a fee. In some cases it’s free. So do shop around before making your choice.\n\u003e This ‘plot of land’ is one of many within a server. Think of a server as a street where many companies rent out space for websites. A bit like sharing the same postcode.\n\u003e Each server has what’s called an IP, or internet protocol, address. This is made up of a string of numbers that can be located by any device that has internet access.\n\u003e Every website has a domain name. This is everything after the www. or World Wide Web part. You can think of this as the physical address of your house.\n\u003e But what if someone wants to find you, or in this case your website? They’d use a browser like Google Chrome. This locates and retrieves the website information, and then displays it. How long a website takes to load depends on things such as the amount and type of information, and internet speeds.\n\n## Key website ingredients\n1. Choosing a website name\n2. Planning how site is structured\n\n\u003e Goal; Make it easy for customers find you\n\nChoosing a [domain name](notes/domains)\n- Check if what you want is available\n- Search for Domain Registar\n- A good one is something people can remember easily\n	- Short\n	- To the point\n	- Relevant\n\nCommon parts\n1. Homepage - first page people see after they type in\n	- Shop window\n	- Where you invite people in\n	- Navigation - How it directs people to other parts of the website\n		- Lets people travel from one site to another\n		- Should always appear to all parts of the website\n- How you organize a site is very important. Think what content you want to offer and group in ways that make sense.\n\nPages and sections\n- About\n	- Photos of best work\n	- Story\n- Contact us\n	- Address, phone number, email, map\n\n\u003e Think of what visitors are thinking of.\n\n- Hyperlinks\n- Shopping baskets\n\n## Meeting business needs\n\u003e Keep goals in mind but consider what customers are looking for.\n\nThink of what you want people to do and what they want to do.\n\n### Tips\n- Put phone number at very visible location everyone. Or add text.\n- Make contact page easy to find.\n- Allow mobile users to find you at one click.\n- Including maps\n- Do they want certifications? Etc.\n\nIf interested to learn about what users are doing, learn about [marketing-analytics](marketing-analytics.md)\n\n### Content\n- Avoid technical jargon and chest-beating about how great you are\n- Explain that you can meet needs of customer/ solve problem they have by framing it in terms of what you can to help visitors\n- Write in a tone that is confident, but not intimidating\n- Explain concepts in everyday language\n- Use stories\n	- Videos\n	- Testimonials\n	- Let people write reviews\n- Use images, headline, clear navigation to help them find what they are looking for\n	- People don't spend much time\n\n## Website usability\n- Making it easier for users to accomplish what they want\n\n### Providing simple and clear navigation\n- Stuff that guides business around site\n- Good navigation: Makes sense for visitors\n	- Has a search box at every page\n		- So they always find it\n- When people visit things across the web, they expect the same thing\n	- Logo at every page and click on it will take you home\n\n### Creating a consistent layout\nStyle\nGeneral guidelines\n- Should be consistent\n- Color\n	- Dark text over light background\n- Where on page content goes to\n	- Don't make it too long\n- Use heads and bullet lists\n\n### Writing relevant and effective content\n- Write for your audience\n- Encourage visitors to take an action when they visit your site\n	- [Call to action](notes/cta.md)\n		- Call now, get directions, buy now\n\n\u003e Make it easy to use.",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Google digital garage"},"/notes/growth-tracking":{content:"- **Tags:** #come-back \n- **Relevant Notes**\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights\n\n## Tooling\n- [How I use FigJam to track my career growth | by Justine Win | Aug, 2021 | Justine Win Stories](https://stories.justinewin.com/how-i-use-figjam-to-track-my-career-growth-4db18b051f9f)\n	- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1005271829052007459)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Career growth trackingg"},"/notes/handling-applicants":{content:"- [Writing rejection emails](notes/rejection-emails.md)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"Handling applicants"},"/notes/hanlon":{content:"- **Tags:** #permanent-notes \n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [design-teams](notes/design-teams.md)\n	- [leadership](moc/leadership.md)\n	- [positive-leadership](notes/positive-leadership.md)\n	- [kindness](moc/kindness.md)\n	- [mental-models](notes/mental-models.md)\n	- [biases](notes/biases.md)\n\n## Notes\n- ***“Never attribute to malice or stupidity that which can be explained by moderately rational individuals following incentives in a complex system of interactions.”*** \n- You should assume the best in people.\n\n## Highlights\n- [How Teams Can Be More Supportive With Help From Hanlon’s Razor](https://blog.trello.com/trello-hanlons-razor)[^1]\n	- “Never attribute to malice or stupidity that which can be explained by moderately rational individuals following incentives in a complex system of interactions.”  \n	- Much like its cousin (and name inspiration) Occam’s Razor, Hanlon’s Razor can help us avoid unreasonable assumptions, build stronger relationships, and navigate the world in a more rational way—in the workplace or out of it. \n	- Hanlon’s Razor helps us look at other people’s actions through a more objective lens, and reminds us that people usually aren’t even thinking about us, let alone wickedly cackling as they scheme over evil plans. \n	- In practice\n		- “My friend hasn’t been liking my social media posts as much as usual.”\n			- Flawed thinking: “I must have done something that made her angry.”\n			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe she’s on a digital detox for her mental health.” \n		- “The mechanic didn’t give me as low of a rate as he usually does.”\n			- Flawed thinking: “He must be trying to overcharge me, since I told him I don’t know much about cars.” \n			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe he’s trying to value his labor more highly and stop undercharging his clients.” \n		- “My child’s teacher didn’t say hello when I dropped him off today.” \n			- Flawed thinking: “What if she takes her bad mood out on my son?” \n			- Hanlon’s Razor: “Maybe she’s tired, or getting over a cold.” \n		- Casts light on biases\n			- [Confirmation bias](notes/confirmation-bias.md)\n			- [Availability bias](notes/availability-bias.md)\n			- At work\n				- “Jane didn’t show up for our scheduled Zoom meeting.” \n					- Availability bias: “She’s trying to get back at me, because I couldn’t help her with that project last week.”\n					- Hanlon’s Razor: “There could be a million reasons she didn’t show—another meeting came up, her notifications aren’t working, or her cat barfed on her iPhone.”\n				- “My boss just emailed me asking to set up an urgent one-on-one meeting.”\n					- Confirmation bias: “She’s got bad news.

Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own . . .” Epictetus\n\nThe single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather— no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change.\n\n### Journal\n\n“Few care now about the marches and countermarches of the Roman commanders. What the centuries have clung to is a notebook of thoughts by a man whose real life was largely unknown who put down in the midnight dimness not the events of the day or the plans of the morrow, but something of far more permanent interest, the ideals and aspirations that a rare spirit lived by.” — Brand Blanshard\n\n### Practice Misfortune\nSeneca, who enjoyed great wealth as the adviser of Nero, suggested that we ought to set aside a certain number of days each month to practice poverty. Take a little food, wear your worst clothes, get away from the comfort of your home and bed. Put yourself face to face with want, he said, you’ll ask yourself “Is this what I used to dread?”\n\nPractice what you fear, whether a simulation in your mind or in real life. The downside is almost always reversible or transient.\n\n### Train Perceptions\n\n“Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been.” — Marcus Aurelius*\n\nSuppose for a second that you are trying to help someone and they respond by being surly or unwilling to cooperate. Instead of making your life more difficult, the exercise says, they’re actually directing you towards new virtues; for example, patience or understanding. Or, the death of someone close to you; a chance to show fortitude.\n\n\"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”*\n\n### Remember - It's All Ephemeral\n\n“Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend…or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.”*\n\nIt is important to note that ‘passion’ here isn’t the modern usage we’re familiar with as in enthusiasm or caring about something. As Don Robertson explains in his book, when the Stoics discuss overcoming ‘passions’, which they called patheiai, they refer to the irrational, unhealthy and excessive desires and emotions. Anger would be a good example. What is important to remember, and this is the crucial bit, they seek to replace them with eupatheiai, such as joy instead of excessive pleasure.\n\nRemember that achievements can be ephemeral, and that your possession of them is for just an instant.\n\n*If everything is ephemeral, what does matter? Right now matters. Being a good person and doing the right thing right now, that’s what matters and that’s what was important to the Stoics.*\n\n## Take the View From Above\n\n“How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about people, it’s best to take a bird’s- eye view and see everything all at once— of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign people, holidays, memorials, markets— all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites.” — Marcus Aurelius\n\nMarcus would often practice an exercise that is referred to as “taking the view from above” or “Plato’s view.” It invites us to take a step back, zoom out and see life from a higher vantage point than our own. This exercise—envisioning all the millions and millions of people, all the “armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths”—prompts us to take perspective and just like the previous exercise, remind us how small we are. It reorients us, and as Stoic scholar Pierre Hadot put it, **“*The view from above changes our value judgments on things: luxury, power, war…and the worries of everyday life become ridiculous.”***\n\nSeeing how small we are in the grand scheme of things is only one portion of this exercise. The second, more subtle point, is to tap into what the Stoics call sympatheia, or a mutual interdependence with the whole of humanity. As the astronaut Edgar Mitchell, one of the first people to actually experience a real ‘view from above’ put it, “In outer space you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.” Take a step back from your own concerns and remind yourself of your duty to others. Take Plato’s view.\n\n### Memento Mori: Meditate on Your Mortality\n“Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. … The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” Seneca*\n\n## Premeditatio Malorum → Premeditation of Evils\n“What is quite unlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster. This is a reason for ensuring that nothing ever takes us by surprise. We should project our thoughts ahead of us at every turn and have in mind every possible eventuality instead of only the usual course of events… Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck. All the terms of our human lot should be before our eyes.” — Seneca***\n\nThe premeditatio malorum (“the pre-meditation of evils”) is a Stoic exercise of imagining things that could go wrong or be taken away from us. It helps us prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks. We don’t always get what is rightfully ours, even if we’ve earned it. Not everything is as clean and straightforward as we think they may be. Psychologically, we must prepare ourselves for this to happen. It is one of the most powerful exercise in the Stoics’ toolkit to build resilience and strength.\n\n### Amor Fati\n\n“To love only what happens, what was destined. No greater harmony.” — Marcus Aurelius*\nThe great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would describe his formula for human greatness as amor fati—a love of fate. “That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it….but love it.”\n\nThe Stoics were not only familiar with this attitude but they embraced it. Two thousand years ago, writing in his own personal journal which would become known as Meditations, Emperor Marcus Aurelius would say: “A blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.” Another Stoic, Epictetus, who as a crippled slave has faced adversity after adversity, echoed the same: \n***“Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy.”***",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.9784586Z",title:"How to Be Stoic"},"/notes/how-to-apologize":{content:"- **Tags:**\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [leadership](moc/leadership.md)\n	- [learning-thinking-communicating](moc/learning-thinking-communicating.md)\n\n\n## Notes\n- **Apologizing to a colleague**\n	- Make it personal: Private \u003e public\n	- Just admit the mistake, don't try to defend yourself/ make yourself look better\n	- **Formula**\n		1.

I’d always remind the recipient of how we met and explain why I was emailing them, and then I’d mock up a screenshot of how Intercom would look if they started using it and tailor the message to their use case.\nYou need to constantly be working on marketing tactics that are actually getting people to buy your product.\n### [Start with why](notes/perdev/life-advice/start-with-why)]\n- No matter how good your product is, if you can’t tell a cohesive, compelling story about it, you’re going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when you actually do take it to market. \n- Why\n	- Marketing, at the end of the day, is not just about a company’s mission. It’s about understanding why a customer would care about that mission, and translating that understanding into a story\n- How\n	- People don’t care about you, people care about themselves and their problems.\n	- Have clear understanding of customer and [understand problem you can solve for them](understand-problem-of-customers) (see: [customer-journey](notes/customer-journey))\n- What\n	- Once you’ve sold someone on your story and shown them how your product can solve their problem, you should back it up with hard claims about how effective your product will be in solving their problem to accelerate their decision making.\n	- How to frame your what\n		- Justification: Why you?\n		- Differentation: What makes you different?\n### Marketing at a product first company\n- Marketing should be invoved at every stage of the funnel.\n- I started with Intercom’s homepage.\n	- The majority of people who visit your marketing site don’t have the time to invest in learning what it is you actually do. If you can’t communicate that clearly on your homepage they’ll just bounce, quite literally, off your site – an opportunity gone.\n- The next most important step is amplifying the things your product team is building.\n\n### Getting word of mouth for your startup\n- Great messaging is simple, compelling, specific, differentiated and defensible.\n	- Simple. It’s easily understood by current and prospective customers.\n	- Compelling. It describes something that is interesting or desirable to them.\n	- Specific. It captures what your product does, not an overly abstract statement of it.\n	- Differentiated. It includes something that makes it unique among peers.\n	- Defensible. It shouldn’t be easy for your competitor to adopt/copy your messaging.\n### Content, then marketing\n[content-marketing](notes/content-marketing.md)\n- Here are five principles we hold dear regarding content.\n	1.

Being able to use pauses and own your stage can make your speech a lot more powerful and confident.[^1]\n- Whenever I give a speech I never use a script. Instead I create an outline and have bullet points that I want to hit. This makes the speech a lot more engaging and means I avoid going into British Airways mode.[^2]\n-  Speeches don't need to be formal. Audiences care most about having fun which means a speech with some banter, humour, and storytelling is going to be a lot more engaging that one without these things.[^3]\n- [How To Improve Public Speaking Skills - Google Digital Garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/public-speaking)[^4]\n	- **1 - Define the objective**\n		- Think of:\n		- Who?\n			- Consider knowledge level\n			- Who are you giving the speech to\n		- How?\n			- Setting\n				- F2F?\n			- Equipment\n				- Microphone - Handheld?\n			- Slides\n				- Remote control?

Rather than “How often do you log in to your email account”? When questions use language like ‘often,’ it leaves a lot of room for subjective interpretation about what often actually means.\n		17.

Sending a note[^1]\n- They suggest:\n	- Sending a note.\n	- Making it handwritten or digital.\n	- Making it personal.\n	- Showing that you’re interested in the job.\n	- Showing that you paid attention to the conversation.\n- Eno Eka\n	- I always send a thank you note/ email and I advise my clients to do so because:\n		- It is the polite thing to do.\n		- It gives you an opportunity to reiterate some points shared during the interview and the value you bring to the table\n		- It shows genuine interest in the position\n		- Most people won’t send it, it helps you stand out.\n		- Even if you don’t get the job, a memorable thank you note keeps you top of mind and allows you to keep the door open to follow up on other opportunities.\n- Jennifer (Jen) Wrobel\n	- I believe in expressing gratitude for their time and consideration, but then again I am that leader who will send handwritten thank you notes to my team and even to their significant others in the situations where they have worked significant hours and spent a lot of time away from their home and family. To me, [sharing appreciation never goes out of style!](notes/perdev/kindness/appreciation.md)\n- Sarah Smith (she/her)\n	- On the hiring end, thank-you notes matter a great deal. It tells me if the \u003cmark\u003ecandidate is resourceful (can find my email online, or took it from the calendar invite), it helps convey what the candidate took away from the conversation, it shows their writing style and it cements the interest\u003c/mark\u003e. Sometimes, I’ve been on the fence about an interview and a thank-you note has convinced me to push the candidate to the next step.\n\n\n[^1]: [Thanks or no thanks?

This culture holds back women. "Not only is their advancement stymied, but also corporations miss out on capturing valuable talent."[^1]\n	- Managers should take conscious effort into distributing work with equity.\n\n## Highlights\n- [Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions)[^1]\n	- Our studies demonstrate that although neither men nor women really want to volunteer for thankless tasks, women volunteer more, are asked to volunteer more, and accept requests to volunteer more than men. These differences do not appear to result from gender differences in preferences, but rather from a shared understanding that women will volunteer more than men.\n	- While our results are disconcerting, they also provide a silver lining in suggesting how employees and managers can reduce the inequity in work tasks. The solution is not for women to decline more work requests — which would present problems for organizations and hold repercussions for women — but **instead for management to find ways to distribute tasks more equitably.** Rather than asking for volunteers or asking women to volunteer because they are likely to say yes, managers could consider rotating assignments across employees, for example. Understanding that women volunteer more simply because men are reluctant to do so should also lead men to volunteer more themselves and should empower women to demand fairer treatment.\n	- **If this burden falls disproportionately on women, not only is their advancement stymied, but also corporations miss out on capturing valuable talent.**\n\n[^1]: [Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions)',lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.982458586Z",title:"Untitled Page"},"/notes/workshop-ally":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [privilege](notes/privilege.md)\n- **References**\n\n\n## Notes\n### Practice tips\n1.

Play with the emotions of the readers such as fear, surprise, or their senses. There are different techniques you can try:\n	1. Add in a sensory flair to you writing. Keenly describe the scenario with different sentences.\n	2. You can break some writing rules in a sentence.\n	3. Build tension and suspense. You can use one-liners or intense cliffhangers.\n	4. You can make writing that severely precise in quick succession.\n	5. You can end the sentence with a sudden surprise.\n\n## Highlights\n- 11 Favorite Sentences (and What They Teach Us About Good Writing[^1]\n	- A good sentence is an adventure. As the sentences above show, there’s not just one way to write a good sentence. A good sentence can be long or short, and it can even be broken. There’s rhythm, sensory appeal, and poetry—even in prose.\n	- On sentences\n		- Sensory appeal\n			- Sitting here now by the open window, a glissando of birdsong on the very lightest of breezes that carries with it the scent of a final incoming summer, I cling to poetry as I cling to life.\n			- In one sentence, Myers describes a visual detail (an open window), an auditory detail (a glissando of birdsong), a scent (the scent of a final incoming summer), and a sense of motion or touch (the lightest breeze). These sensory descriptions transport readers, letting them experience the story as if they’re there.\n	- A journey in one sentence\n	- The broken beauty\n		- A good sentence can be “broken.” Not every sentence needs a subject and a verb.\n	- The suspense\n	- The cliff edge\n	- Precision\n		- This sentence contains a lot of detail in quick succession.\n	- The surprise\n	- The question\n\n\n[^1]: [11 Sentence Examples: Why Are These Sentences So Good?](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/sentence-examples/)",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.982458586Z",title:"How to write better sentences"},"/notes/writing-for-marketers":{content:"- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [writing](moc/writing.md)\n\n## Sources\n- [Power Words | Fomo - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CQtH_Okw5jvqKg1E4ftDs0RMfwILxn8AhGYU8pywTIM/edit#gid=2074100514)\n## Notes\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:28.982458586Z",title:"Writing for marketers"},"/notes/writing-marketing-copy":{content:"---\n\n- **Relevant Notes**\n	- [writing](moc/writing.md)\n\n## Processing\n- Related to: [drunk mode](notes/drunk-mode.md)\n- Start in the middle\n- Give it a structure\n- Don't focus on spelling and grammar\n- Wriite one piece per timed sprint (see: [pomodoro](notes/productivity/pomodoro)\n\n## Writing\n1.

If you're at the low level, you won't really improve.

Generic principles\n	- Generic principles\n	- Some say that there are no generic principles\n2. Mental models\n	- Perspective to the world\n	- Ex. [[Opportunity costs]]\n		- Can be applied into many aspects of our life\n3. Situational principles\n	- A rule at a specific scenario\n4. Life values or virtues\n	- Just words/ very short\n	- How you see the worlds\n5. Biases\n	- May be very personal\n6. Habits\n	- Small rules or specific habits\n7. Methods/ Best practices\n\n\u003e They can influence each other\n\n### Becoming principles\n- To be principled is to act according to your goals and values/ how you can be coherent/ aligned with who you want to be\n	- Ways you can measure this\n		1. Aligned between principles and self (goals, values, personalities)\n		2. Aligned between principles and actions\n\n#### Steps to learn principles\n1. Be aware\n	- Resolve unknowns, about breadth\n2. Understand\n	- Correctly and deeply\n3. Believe\n	- Make sure you believe it is useful for you\n	- Try to learn from other people\n4. Remember\n	- Have it in your hat\n	- Hard to build up because we need to build-up\n5. Plan and forecast\n	- When you are learning a principle, it is different to apply it at a situation. Planning in BETWEEN is a completely different thing also.\n	- The idea to forecast is different also\n6. Apply\n	- Think how you can convert something generic into action\n7. Track feedback\n8. Iterate\n\n### Why become "principled"?\n - ==Our brain is not evolved to be principled==\n	 - Brain is shortsighted *(we want short-term pleasure than long-term)*, emotional *(reactive to environment)*, experience-driven *(we tend to do things we are used to doing)*, not enough computation, geared for energy-optimization *(we optimize for decisions that take the lessest energy)*; memory is biased\n - Help you have full perspectives and think in advance\n - Help overcome our emotions\n - Help you grow faster, and maker better decisions\n\n#### How are principles used by titans?\n1. [[Charlie Munger]]\n2. [[Ray Dalio]]\n3. [[Naval Ravikant]]\n	- Co-founder of [[AngelList]]\n\n### Collecting public principles\n1. Mindset 1: Passive\n	- See it as a life habit, discover through experience\n		- Read and consume information\n		- Take notes\n		- Something you would do anytime\n	- Practice it an exercise\n2. Mindset 2: Active\n	- Find a principle for specific problem\n\n#### How to find public principles?\n1. Pick a problem\n2. Do some research–Brown principles from good sources\n	- Methods\n		- Google\n		- Books\n			- Goodreads\n			- mostrecommendedbooks.com\n		- Listen to audio\n			- Podcasts\n			- Turn article to audio: Pocket\n	- Good sources of principles\n		- openprinciples.org\n		- principles.org\n		- "Principles" by Ray Dalio\n		- The Knowledge project podcast\n		- fs.blog\n		- Upgradable.org\n3. Record your principle\n	- [[ADEPT method]]\n		- Analogy, diagram, example of situation, plain english, technical definition\n\n### How to avoid biased principles?\n- Avoid\n	- Absolute statements like never, always, everyone, like\n	- #come-back \n\n\n## Every week...\n- Share principle per week\n- 8 minutes\n- Add in from the fellowship hub\n\n## Comments\n- Learning curve in Notion\n-

Our words are too powerful to impart things callously. I've seen people give feedback differently, and I think there's no super perfect formula into giving it because people are so unpredictable and subjective. I adjust my approach, but what I always seek to maintain is to relay feedback in a **constructive manner that helps a person move forward concretely**.\n\nA common argument against taking a very systematic and calculated approach is that we take away the directness of things. However, [directness just isn't an excuse to be an asshole.](notes/perdev/better/directness.md) You can find balance into creating [safe spaces](notes/perdev/mh/safe-spaces.md), [psychological safety](notes/psychological-safety.md), and being candid.",lastmodified:"2022-04-10T17:03:29.098458185Z",title:"How I give feedback"},"/projects/interplays":{content:"---\n\n\u003e Note: **Not final paper uploaded here.** This is a collection of \u003cu\u003esome\u003c/u\u003e random thought processes, brainstorm, and pre-readings.\n\n*What my space looks like when writing*\n![interplays-workspace](/photos/interplays-workspace.png)\n\n## Research Document\n\n[PH's Grade 4 students lowest in math, science around the world -- int'l study | Inquirer News](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1370289/phs-grade-4-students-lowest-in-math-science-around-the-world-study)\n- ==Only one percent reached the high benchmark==, meaning, “students can apply conceptual understanding to solve problems.”\n- In 2019, Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that ==Filipinos fared worst among 79 countries in reading literacy and second-lowest in both mathematical and scientific literacy.==\n- ==“I call this a major crisis in the education of the country,” he said.==\n- “We have to address this crisis and we cannot just sleep quietly and comfortably knowing that our students are performing very poorly and continue to perform poorly in a lot of the examination,” he added.\n\n\n[The Biggest Failure of Math Education: Enabling Elitism and Classism | by Sunil Singh | Medium](https://sunilsingh-42118.medium.com/the-biggest-failure-of-math-education-enabling-elitism-and-classism-b7e7e23938c8)\n- ==Make your daughter practice math, she'll thank you later==\n- That the article ==reinforces the status afforded to learning mathematics, while being completely oblivious that this call for daughters to practice more mathematics seems to be directed at daughters you might find on Nickelodeon television shows.==\n\n[Socioeconomic Influence on Mathematical Achievement: What Is Visible and What Is Neglected | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12688-3_19)\n- ==It is known that socioeconomic factors have an influence on mathematical achievement.== Nowadays such link has become a “fact” that researchers, teachers, administrators and politicians have at hand: “the better off you—and your family—are, the more likely you will do well in school, including mathematics”. Such a statement embodies its opposite: ==“the worse off you—and your family—are, the more likely you will do poorly in school and mathematics”.== ==Studies defining socio-economic status (SES) and showing its relation to school performance== emerged at the beginning of the 20th century.\n- At a general educational level, the relationship between socioeconomic factors and school achievement is inserted in the ==history of expansion of mass education systems and differential access to education around the world== during the 20th century.\n- Prior to the existence of international comparable, standardized national data sets, the variable of ==socioeconomic status has been one of the most used in the studies.== Since its construction in the 1920s, the measurement has been composed by a series of reliable indicators—parents’ educational level, family income, possession of appliances, possession of books, etc.—which have not changed much in almost 100 years. [[imc-proof]]\n- For example, ==low achievement in mathematics in certain regions in China is explained by the intersection of rurality, parents’ educational level, mother-at-work, and language== (Hu and Du 2009).\n- There is an over-representation of research reports addressing the socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement in English speaking countries (USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand), while there is little research on this matter in many other places in the world. Such difference may not only be due to the extent of research in mathematics education in these countries, but also to the fact that differential achievement has not been construed as a problem. In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why. ==In Taiwan research discards the focus on socio-economic variables and privileges variables such as student’s learning goal orientation== (Lin et al. 2009).\n- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==\n- There have been recent reports that consider race, class, gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency in relation to mathematics education (e.g., Strutchens and Silver 2000; Tate 1997). ==They support the intuitive finding that higher socioeconomic status is associated with increased course-taking and higher achievement on various measures of mathematics achievement.==\n- ==One can claim that it is an important aim for mathematics education to help to establish possibilities within the horizon of students’ foregrounds (Skovsmose 2005).== To make them recognise that: This could also be for me!\n\n[Teachers’ Perception of Social Justice in Mathematics Classrooms](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED573753.pdf)\n- Social justice has been one of the major issues in education in general and mathematics education in particular. What mathematics is taught in the classroom? Whose mathematics is taught? Who teaches mathematics and to whom? How do teachers teach the subject in the classroom? What context teachers use in teaching mathematics? How do students participate in learning mathematics? How do parents support their children in learning mathematics? ==How does school system maintain access to the resources for students? Do all students have access to resources to learn mathematics? Does education policy support equitable mathematics education for all students? How does power and politics play a role in supporting or hindering students’ empowerment through learning of mathematics?== These questions and others have been the major concerns of mathematics education community in recent years. This paper is developed around these questions. Now what follows in this paper are - theoretical foundation of social justice in mathematics classroom, research method, findings and discussion, and implication of the study. \n- ==In the cultural context of the United States, male children and female children, working-class children and middle-class children, black children and white children often do not have equally enabling educational opportunities even when an equivalent amount of resources has been devoted to their education.

I can't recall exactly, but I think I bought the piso per piece candy.\n\nWhat I do vividly remember is that I felt annoyed then because the _tindera_ gave me an _oozing-from-my-hands_ sized heaps of 10 cents and 25 cents. Burdened by the heaviness (and as a naive 5 year old), when I passed by the basketball court and came across the area where tall grass covers the ground, I threw away all the coins leaving none behind. Feeling happier, I opened my candy and went back home, pocket empty and mind infused with sweets.\n\nFast forward to 2021, I still think of how much money that was and how much candy I could have bought with that money. In a population of over 7 billion, I'm just one of many, and truth be told, I'm sure that this behavior is something not only I, but many people display. May it not be a literal form of throwing away money, it may be in the form of wasting money on menial pleasures and impulsive purchases–there's that side of society provided the privilege in doing so.\n\nThe sterling fact remains–**we were afforded the privilege in doing so**—while many have to scrap for the money I just tossed away.\n\nI've had conversations about privilege with my friends for multiple times. I honestly still struggle to completely wrap my head at the reality that _poverty is real_. I only started to realize this when I entered a state university in senior high.\n\nApparently, at the other side of the spectrum from those who can impulse buy Shopee finds are people who scrap away at every coin that they see–those who cannot throw away every single coin that they have.\n\nIt is evident that in the world exists a class divide wherein those who are in the upper class are afforded the privilege to exist in that bubble whereas those outside that remain in their circle. Clearly, there is an apparent classist system.\n\nThe question then is–why? Is it by choice? By laziness (as a detached privileged person would post online _\"You are rich because you are lazy!\"_)?\n\nIn this paper, I argue that the underlying reasons behind the classism is a lack of support in education–specifically, mathematics. Through this manuscript, I hope to unveil the interplays of mathematics and classism–that issues in both exist in a cause-effect spectrum ultimately predefining a person's faith.\n\n**Current Status Quo**\n\n\u003e 16.6% people live below the poverty line.[^2]\n\u003e 6% of Filipino students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in simple situations. [^4]\n\u003e 1% of Filipino students can apply conceptual understanding to solve problems. [^4]\n\u003e 6 out of 10 families are deprived of basic education.[^5]\n\u003e 23.9% are multi-dimensionally deprived.[^5]\n\nFirst off, I honestly have a love-hate relationship with statistics. While, yes, we learn about things in quantitative and tangible manners, I hate how we use it to reduce people to mere numbers.\n\nThe statistics as written above show one aspect of our current status quo: many are deprived of education and many live below the poverty line. Sadly, this is only one of the many problems Philippines faces today–in fact, on top of other problems such as a broken political system or the current pandemic, this drowns in the sea of problems that need to be \"urgently addressed\" but are tucked down.\n\nThat being said, with this problem perpetuating consistently unknowingly with only few granted the privilege of thinking about this problem, how do we solve it?\n\nIn order to answer the question, as an avid believer in approaching problems at the root cause, I first seek to unveil the reasons behind this building on the premise that education and socioeconomic status have a relationship predetermining each other.\n\n**Predetermination of success**\n\nWhat if I told you I can **statistically determine** how likely you are to fail?\n\nAs we grow up, we are told about how education is integral to success, as well as how grit, motivation, and perseverance are important as we try to traverse to life. At the street, this sounds like: _You're lazy? You'll be poor!_\n\nI scavenged through Google about what a successful person has, or what they have that other people don't (Insert photo here). I had one search criteria in mind: Look for the articles that are most **popular, easy to read, and appealing**–or the ones blessed by SEO and traffic. Condensing them, here are  the most recurring themes:\n\n- Be passionate\n- Stay motivated\n- Build yourself forward!\n\nThings I went through:\n\n- [8 Simple Ways to Be Successful—from 8 Inspiring Leaders.](https://ce.uci.edu/careerzot/8-simple-ways-successful-8-inspiring-leaders/)\n- [The Keys to Success - 10 Things You Can Start Doing Now](https://finallyfamilyhomes.org/10-keys-to-success-in-life/)\n- [How to Be Successful in Life [2019] | Brian Tracy](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/personal-success-keys-to-success-change-your-life/)\n- [6 Steps for Success in Life](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-be-successful-in-life-4165743)\n- [How to Be Successful (And Get Everything You Want in Life)](https://www.oberlo.com.ph/blog/how-to-be-successful)\n\nApparently, all of these focused solely on the **motivation/ character** aspect of what it takes someone to be successful–which is honestly, a very shallow view. I strongly believe that the total consideration of character is incomplete. To delve deeper into this, as a health student, I would like to reference the [social determinants of health](https://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/ConceptualframeworkforactiononSDH_eng.pdf)–essentially, health does not exist in a vacuum–it is the culmination of multiple factors affecting one's health.[^1]\n\n\n\u003e If we consider this fact, we can then infer that **one's conditions are not isolated yes-no relationships determined by one thing (not character especially!)*; rather, they are formed out of multiple atomic factors culminating into one's circumstance.\n\nBuilding on my introduction, let's derive our own success rate equation. *(Note: Most definitely not an accurate one).*\n\nIn order to do this, I'd like to look into two contexts:\n\n1. **What a person is born with** (Innate factors)\n2. **What a person is subjected to** (External factors)\n\nLet's piece this one by one.\n\nWhen we are born, we have the following absolute things: **sex** and **parents**. An important thing to note is that our parents by default determine our socioeconomic status. In mathematical notation, this would look like the following:\n\n$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$\n\nThat being said, in this consideration, socioeconomic status itself can serve as headsign with \"I will be around 50% successful in relationship to Elon Musk.\"\n\nOf course, socioeconomic status is comprised of too many things. Then, if we add in factors for luck, we can get\n\n$innate factors=sex+socioeconomic status$\n\n$success = (sex)(socioeconomic status)(luck)(character)$\n\n\u003e If socioeconomic status hence serves as such an integral factor\n\nIn addition, one interesting fact I'd like to point out is that studies show that Filipinos are determined to achieve the bare minimum to be renumerated.[^3] I have yet to find the reason as to why, but I believe it can be attributed\n\n**Math**\n- ==Poverty, rurality, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, race, among others, have been defined as the variables that constitute socioeconomic influences on mathematical achievement.==[^7]\n-  ==There was a low performance of the students in the public schools than the students of private schools in mathematics and other subjects== (MOE, 2015).[^8]\n\n**Unsorted**\n**Social justice**\nWe give little credit.\n- In East Asia there is little research in mathematics education investigating those who do not perform highly and why.
