👋 I'm Rajan

💡 I'm in love with learning! And I genuinely want to become more intentional with it.. here's me committing it into existence. 🌸

🧠 In this garden/ [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), I publish my learning notes, journeys, and projects as [evergreen notes](https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-evergreen-notes/) that I continue to cultivate and grow–there is no perfect *end state*, and it will always be a work in progress! My notes range from fleeting notes to completely fleshed out permanent notes. I write more about digital gardens [here.](home/garden.md)

👋 When I'm not here, you can find me curating in [Are.na](https://are.na/chloe-abrasada) or reading in [Matter](https://getmatter.app/chloeabrasada). Right now, I'm also building a passion project on sustainability called [Sirkular, where I'm jumpstarting with critiquing sustainable fashion](https://www.are.na/developh-camp/ph-sustainable-fashion).
